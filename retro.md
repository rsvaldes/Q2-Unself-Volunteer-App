# Retrospective

### What Went Well

* We got the shell of our application up and running on Heroku the first day
* We addressed problems in an efficiant and respectful way
* We utilized each others strengths
* We didn't get hung up on little design changes
* Staying agile and focusing on finishing one feature at a time
* Paring with new people every day 
* Regression testing in the latter half of the week



### What We Could Have Done Well

* We should have broken up functions into smaller bits
* Left more time to refactor and clean functions up
* More detailed in user stories and feature descriptions
* Some of us didn't get outside our comfort zones as much as they would have liked
* Regression testing in the earlier half of the week



### Advice

* Really commit to staying agile and don't cut corners towards the end when you feel rushed
* Be okay giving up control/open to different ways of doing things.
* Build your features one at a time all the way through
* Create detailed stories for the entire project before you start coding



### What We Will Do Next Sprint

* More update and delete functionality
* Working on things further outside comfort zone
* More complete design plan up front
