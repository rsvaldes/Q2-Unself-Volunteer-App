This app was a lot of fun to work on. A couple of the more difficult challenges we tackled in this project were:

1) Deciding how to handle users with different roles, in this case, charity organizations and volunteers.  We approached this by having separate account creation pages for organizations and volunteers.  Only organizations have the ability to enter new events and only volunteers have the ability to signup for events. Both users have the ability to view events they are associated with.  Wherever possible, we created common code that was utilized by both interfaces.

2) The other area in which we decided to take a more complicated route was in creating event roles.  We could have chosen to have volunteers sign up

The technologies we used in this app are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery, and Express and Node for the backend. Thank you to Unself for allowing us the chance to work with you guys and taking the time to give us advice. We see great potential for your company and your mission.
