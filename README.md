## About

#### Purpose

This is our quarterly project we did at Galvanize while working with the social technology company [Unself](https://www.unself.com/welcome "Unself") to build out a new feature for their volunteer app. Their app provides a way for volunteers to keep track their volunteer hours in a simple, straightforward way. Our application extends this functionality by allowing organizations to post upcoming events and volunteers to sign up for specific roles at these events. This empowers both parties by decreasing the gap between organizations and volunteers.

This app was both quite challenging and a lot of fun to work on. The technologies we used in this app are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery on the front end, and Node, Express, and Postgres for the backend. We wanted to give a very big thank you to Unself for allowing us the chance to work with you and taking the time to give us advice and guidance. We see great potential for your mission and wish you the best on it. Thanks everyone for coming out!
